  \begin{abstract}
  The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the global
  COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 led to explosive growth in scientific
  research. Alas, much of the research in the literature lacks
  conditions to be reproducible, and recent publications on the
  association between population density and the basic reproductive
  number of SARS-CoV-2 are no exception. Relatively few papers share
  code and data sufficiently, which hinders not only verification but
  additional experimentation. In this paper, an example of reproducible
  research shows the potential of spatial analysis for epidemiology
  research during COVID-19. Transparency and openness means that
  independent researchers can, with only modest efforts, verify findings
  and use different approaches as appropriate. Given the high stakes of
  the situation, it is essential that scientific findings, on which good
  policy depends, are as robust as possible; as the empirical example
  shows, reproducibility is one of the keys to ensure this.

  This paper is now published in Geographical Analysis
